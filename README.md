# UCH-QoL-Patches
This mod should fix some annoying issues with Ultimate Chicken Horse.

Implemented fixes:
1. Keep Audio running when game is in background (e.g. other window is in focus)
1. Added Configuration Option to change the respawn time in Freeplay mode
    - Added dependency to ConfigurationManager (press F1 in game to change available configurations)
